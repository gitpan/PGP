This is an 0.3 alpha release of a PGP module for Perl5.
	 				       
This module will allow for an easy interface to both Phil
Zimmermann's PGP (v2.6.2) program and the international version of
PGP (v2.6.2i). Although nearly any version of PGP should work. Pipe.pm
will allow you to sign, encrypt (w/signature), decrypt and perform
key management. The only requirement being that you already have PGP
installed on your system to utilize this module.

Previous users of this PGP module should note that the name has
changed to PGP::Pipe to prevent conflicts with other PGP modules.
This will allow for a PGP::Api when the PGP 3.0 API is released. The
next release will split PGP::Pipe into PGP::Pipe, PGP::Keyring, and
PGP::Key. 

There are sure to be many changes in the structure of this module over
the next couple of months--at least until a standard interface is 
acheived. 				  

*** Latest news ***

I now have a mailing list setup for people that are working with the
PGP module. This list is for working on both the module and applica-
tions. To subscribe to the list, send a message to
majordomo@dbc-mifco.com with the following line in the body of the
message (not the subject line): 
	subscribe perl-pgp
      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install
	
Thats all. Real easy--like it should be. There is not a 'make test'
yet. Unfortunately I have not had time to write a bunch of test 
routines. That position is currently looking to be filled :-)

CREDITS

Certainly a great deal of credit should go to Phil Zimmermann. Without
him, the NSA would certainly be reading all of our private files! As
if they are not already reading our files!

There are also many unseen heros out on the internet. Some are helping
Phil with his legal troubles. Others are working on developing 
PGP v3.0. If you know of any of these people, thank them profusely 
on behalf of all the users of PGP.
