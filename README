This is an alpha release of a PGP module for Perl5.
	 
This module will allow for an easy interface to both Phil Zimmermann's
PGP (v2.6.2) program and the international version of PGP (v2.6.2i). 
PGP.pm will allow you to sign, encrypt (w/signature), decrypt and 
perform key management. The only requirement being that you already
have PGP installed on your system to utilize this module.

There are sure to be many changes in the structure of this module over
the next couple of months--at least until a standard interface is 
acheived. 
      
If you find this module useful and wish to see future developments
of it, the contribute to Phil Zimmermann's legal defense fund. If 
you don't know anything about the government's attempt to wrongfully
prosecute Phil, then go to Yahoo and search for "Zimmermann." After
reading for a little while, you will be wondering how the government
is getting away with it's criminal act.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install
	
Thats all. Real easy--like it should be. There is not a 'make test'
yet. Unfortunately I have not had time to write a bunch of test 
routines. That possition is currently looking to be filled :-)

CREDITS

Certainly a great deal of credit should go to Phil Zimmermann. Without
him, the NSA would certainly be reading all of our private files! I 
just wish that I had some money so I could pay for all of his legal
fees. 

There are also many unseen heros out on the internet. Some are helping
Phil with his legal troubles. Others are working on developing 
PGP v3.0. If you know of any of these people, thank them profusely 
on behalf of all the users of PGP.
